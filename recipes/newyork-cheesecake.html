    <p>This cake is easy to make, and it's so delicious. Everyone that's tried it has said it tasted just like the ones in a deli! You'll love it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 graham crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
        <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch springform pan.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.</li>
    </ol>
